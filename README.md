# DATA CLEANING & EXPLORATION
The data was downloaded from Kaggle.com. It contained the number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19. It was cleaned and explored using PostgreSQL.

I Imported the csv file into postgre by first creating a database and table. Then I set up column names with their respective data types. I Checked for duplicates by using CTE Table and observed no duplicates.
I explored the data using queries.
